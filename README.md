# Movies-ETL

## Overview

After helping Amazing Prime with the dataset for the hackathon, an automated pipeline that takes in new data, transforms the data and loads it into existing tables. This new code will be used to keep the dataset up to date. The code used to extract, tranform and load the data for the hackathon was refactored to take in the Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data and perform the ETL process with the data loaded in a database for easy updating.
